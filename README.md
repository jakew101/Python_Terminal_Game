## Face card or nah?
Six cards from a full deck of playing cards are drawn. 
The first card is placed face up in front of the player. 
The player guesses if the next card is higher or lower. 
If correct, the player guesses if the next card is in between or outside of the two face up cards. 
If correct, the player guesses if the next card is red or black. 
If correct, the player guesses the suit of the next card. 
If correct, the player answers the final question: face card or nah?
If any of these decisions are not correct or the player correctly guesses each card attribute correctly, the next player goes.
